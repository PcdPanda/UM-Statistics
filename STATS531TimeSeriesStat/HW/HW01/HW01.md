### Question 1.1

1. Based on the definition of $\hat\mu(Y_{1:N})$ and covariance's property P1,P3, we get

$$
\text{Var}(\hat\mu(Y_{1:N}))=\text{Var}(\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N Y_i)=\frac{1}{N^2}\text{Var}(\sum_{i=1}^N Y_i)=\frac{1}{N^2}\text{Cov}(\sum_{i=1}^N Y_i, \sum_{j=1}^N Y_i)
$$

2. Thorough property P2, P4, we can make decomposition
   $$
   \text{Cov}(\sum_{i=1}^N Y_i, \sum_{j=1}^N Y_i)=\sum_{i=1}^N\sum_{j=1}^N\text{Cov}(Y_i, Y_j)=\sum_{i=1}^N\text{Var}(Y_i)+2\sum_{h=1}^{N-1}\sum_{i=1}^{N-h}\text{Cov}(Y_i, Y_{i+h})
   $$
   
3. Since the model is covariance stationary, based on the definition of $\gamma$
   $$
   \gamma_0=\mathbb{E}[(Y_i-\mu_i)^2]=\text{Var}(Y_i)\quad\forall i
   $$

$$
\gamma_h=\mathbb{E}[(Y_i-\mu_i)(Y_{i+h}-\mu_{i+h})]=\text{Cov}(Y_i, Y_{i+h})\quad\forall i
$$

4. Plug the $\gamma$ into the first equation, we get
   $$
   \text{Var}(\hat\mu(Y_{1:N}))=\frac{1}{N^2}[N\gamma_0+2\sum_{h=1}^{N-1}(N-h)\gamma_h]=\frac{\gamma_0}{N}+\frac{2}{N^2}\sum_{h=1}^{N-1}(N-h)\gamma_h
   $$

### Question 1.2 (A)

1. Based on the definition of $\gamma_h$, we get
   $$
   \gamma_h=\frac{U}{V}\\
   \frac{\partial g}{\partial U}=\frac{1}{V}\\
   \frac{\partial g}{\partial V}=-\frac{U}{V^2}
   $$

2. Plug the derivatives, we get
   $$
   Y\approx\frac{\mu_U}{\mu_V}+\frac{U}{\mu_V}-\frac{\mu_U}{\mu_V}-\frac{V\mu_U}{\mu_V^2}+\frac{\mu_U}{\mu_V}=\frac{U\mu_V-V\mu_U+\mu_U\mu_V}{\mu_V^2}
   $$

3. Take the mean on both side, we get
   $$
   \mu_{\hat\rho_h}=\frac{\mu_U}{\mu_V}=\frac{\mathbb{E}(\sum_{n=1}^{N-h}Y_nY_{n+h})}{\mathbb{E}(\sum_{n=1}^N Y_n^2)}=\frac{\sum_{n=1}^{N-h}\text{Cov}(Y_n,Y_{n+h})}{N\sigma^2}
   $$

4. Since $Y_n$ and $Y_{n+h}$ are i.i.d, their covariance should be 0, therefore the mean is
   $$
   \mu_{\hat\rho_h}=\frac{0}{N\sigma^2}=0
   $$

5. Since the mean is $0$, then the variance is 
   $$
   \sigma^2_{\hat\rho_h}=\mathbb{E}[\frac{(U\mu_V-V\mu_U+\mu_U\mu_V)^2}{\mu_V^4}]
   $$

6. Based on previous analysis, we know $\mu_U=0$, therefore

$$
\sigma^2_{\hat\rho_h}=\frac{\mathbb{E}[U^2]}{\mu_V^2}=\frac{\text{Var}(\sum_{n=1}^{N-h}Y_nY_{n+h})}{N^2\sigma^4}
$$

7. Since $Y_{i},Y_{j}$ are uncorrelated and with both mean equals to $0$, then
   $$
   \text{Var}(\sum_{n=1}^{N-h}Y_nY_{n+h})=\sum_{n=1}^{N-h}\text{Var}(Y_nY_{n+h})=\sum_{n=1}^{N-h}\mathbb{E}(Y_n^2Y_{n+h}^2)=(N-h)\sigma^4
   $$

8. Therefore, $\sigma^2_{\hat\rho_h}=\frac{N-h}{N^2}$, the standard deviation will be close to $\frac{1}{\sqrt N}$ with large $N$

### Question 1.2 (B)

According to the definition of confidence interval, the probability that the unknown population parameter in this interval should be 95% or $\alpha$ used to create the interval if our null hypothesis is valid. The procedure of creating the confidence depends on our models and our assumption.

Therefore, if we observe a value out of the confidence interval, it means we're observing an extreme value during our assumption, so that we can reject the null hypothesis at $\alpha$ level of significance. 

In this case, when we're plotting the autocorrelation function, our assumptions is that our model is well-fitting so that the there is no large autocorrelation within the noise, which doesn't depend on the data. If we have a data point out of the interval, it implies our assumption and model may not be working well because it may ignore some correlation information contained in the noise.
